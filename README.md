The aim of this codebase is to create a robust system for efficiently managing different aspects of an educational institution, including tasks like handling student and teacher information, managing course enrollments, and recording grades. Developed entirely using JavaFX, the project features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. MySQL serves as the backend database, storing essential data, while Visual Studio Code is the chosen Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding.
